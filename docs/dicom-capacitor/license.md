Microsoft Patent Promise for .NET Libraries and Runtime Components

Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates ("Microsoft") promise not to assert
any .NET Patents against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale,
importing, or distributing Covered Code, as part of either a .NET Runtime or
as part of any application designed to run on a .NET Runtime.

If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in any claim in a lawsuit
alleging direct or contributory patent infringement by any Covered Code, or
inducement of patent infringement by any Covered Code, then your rights under
this promise will automatically terminate.

This promise is not an assurance that (i) any .NET Patents are valid or
enforceable, or (ii) Covered Code does not infringe patents or other
intellectual property rights of any third party. No rights except those
expressly stated in this promise are granted, waived, or received by
Microsoft, whether by implication, exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise.
This is a personal promise directly from Microsoft to you, and you agree as a
condition of benefiting from it that no Microsoft rights are received from
suppliers, distributors, or otherwise from any other person in connection with
this promise.

Definitions:

"Covered Code" means those Microsoft .NET libraries and runtime components as
made available by Microsoft at https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource.

".NET Patents" are those patent claims, both currently owned by Microsoft and
acquired in the future, that are necessarily infringed by Covered Code. .NET
Patents do not include any patent claims that are infringed by any Enabling
Technology, that are infringed only as a consequence of modification of
Covered Code, or that are infringed only by the combination of Covered Code
with third party code.

".NET Runtime" means any compliant implementation in software of (a) all of
the required parts of the mandatory provisions of Standard ECMA-335 – Common
Language Infrastructure (CLI); and (b) if implemented, any additional
functionality in Microsoft's .NET Framework, as described in Microsoft's API
documentation on its MSDN website. For example, .NET Runtimes include
Microsoft's .NET Framework and those portions of the Mono Project compliant
with (a) and (b).

"Enabling Technology" means underlying or enabling technology that may be
used, combined, or distributed in connection with Microsoft's .NET Framework
or other .NET Runtimes, such as hardware, operating systems, and applications
that run on .NET Framework or other .NET Runtimes.
