# Interrogating the Logs

DICOM Capacitor logs are stored in the `%ProgramData%\Flux\DICOM Capacitor\log` directory.  The main log file is
`capacitor_service.log`.  This file contains a detailed log of all operations performed by DICOM Capacitor.

We recommend using a log viewer such as TailBlazer or BareTail to view the logs in real-time.
